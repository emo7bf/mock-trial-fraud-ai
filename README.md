# Mock Trial Fraud AI

This project simulates a courtroom-style fraud detection system using large language model agents acting as a prosecutor, defender, fact-checker, and judge. It evaluates transactions in the [Fraud Transactions Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dermisfit/fraud-transactions-dataset) using a mock-trial debate structure.

## Features
- Agent-based debate system
- Fact-checker with statistical anomaly detection
- Realistic legal-style arguments
- Accuracy tracking and analytics

## Dataset
Download it from Kaggle: [Fraud Transactions Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dermisfit/fraud-transactions-dataset)

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies in `requirements.txt`
2. Launch the notebook
3. Run the cells with your own API key (or swap in local LLMs)
